      <br>
      <p>
        Document control plays a crucial role in risk management within an organization by ensuring that all important documents, policies, and procedures are properly managed, updated, and accessible to relevant stakeholders. By having a centralized system for document control, organizations can mitigate the risk of errors, inconsistencies, or outdated information being used in decision-making processes.
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, document control helps to establish accountability and transparency within an organization by tracking changes made to documents and maintaining a clear audit trail. This not only reduces the risk of unauthorized access or tampering with sensitive information but also ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.
        <br><br>
        In addition, effective document control practices can help identify potential risks early on by providing a systematic way to review and assess the impact of changes in policies or procedures. By having a well-documented process for managing documents, organizations can proactively address any potential risks before they escalate into larger issues.
        <br><br>
        Overall, document control is an essential component of risk management as it helps organizations maintain accuracy, consistency, and compliance in their operations while minimizing the likelihood of errors, miscommunication, and regulatory violations.
